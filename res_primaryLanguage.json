      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ian Agpawa, a software engineer currently in finance.  I design and develop frontend Angular and React web applications on a platform that focuses on a unified experience for various post-trade event workflows.  Prior to software engineering, I was in the field of psychology.  I received my Bachelors from CUNY Hunter College where I co-authored a study in error-detection rates during proofreading. I then went on to receive my Masters from Teachers College at Columbia University where I focused on developmental psychopathology and posttraumatic growth, while working at a clinical services company that provided services to intellectually disabled individuals throughout the New York City area. I left the field in 2018 to pursue my passion and joined FDM Group as a consultant.  Later I joined IHS Markit, which then merged S&P Global, who then formed a joint venture with CME Group called Osttra, which is where I am today.",
